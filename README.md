Some examples to speed up development in azure 

This repository focuses on people trying to develop websites on the Microsoft Azure Platform using Node.js as their server side language.
It contains the four most commonly used Node.js applications :
  1. Interfacing with a Microsoft SQL/Azure SQL backend using tedious
  2. Using the data obtained from the above to set secure(encrypted) session variables using cookies
  3. Using node-mailer to generate mails and send it to client email id's (Work in progress)
    - Also checking for email address existence using email-existence
  4. Using socket.io with Microsoft Azure Web Apps(xhr-polling) (Work in progress)
  
Let me know about any issues of mistakes I might have made!
Cheers!
